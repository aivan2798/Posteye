# Posteye
An expert.ai based post manager.
A user pastes the link to the desired post in posteye then,
Posteye iterates over the comments in the Facebook post and 
then tracks the sentiment's, emotional traits and behavioral 
traits in the comments and visualises the data in graphs.
The posteye user can then filter the comments based on the
sentiment's values, emotional traits or behavioral traits and
apply actions such as liking or replying to the comment.
